              is widely used in studying chromatin biology, but a comprehensive
              review of the analysis tools has not been completed yet. Here, we
              discuss the major steps in ATAC-seq data analysis, including
              pre-analysis (quality check and alignment), core analysis (peak
              calling), and advanced analysis (peak differential analysis and
              annotation, motif enrichment, footprinting, and nucleosome
              position analysis). We also review the reconstruction of
              transcriptional regulatory networks with multiomics data and
              highlight the current challenges of each step. Finally, we
              describe the potential of single-cell ATAC-seq and highlight the
              necessity of developing ATAC-seq specific analysis tools to
              obtain biologically meaningful insights.",
