              is widely used in studying chromatin biology, but a comprehensive
              review of the analysis tools has not been completed yet. Here, we
              discuss the major steps in ATAC-seq data analysis, including
              pre-analysis (quality check and alignment), core analysis (peak
              calling), and advanced analysis (peak differential analysis and
              annotation, motif enrichment, footprinting, and nucleosome
              position analysis). We also review the reconstruction of
              transcriptional regulatory networks with multiomics data and
              highlight the current challenges of each step. Finally, we
              describe the potential of single-cell ATAC-seq and highlight the
              necessity of developing ATAC-seq specific analysis tools to
              obtain biologically meaningful insights.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Although gene set enrichment analysis has become an
              integral part of high-throughput gene expression data analysis,
              the assessment of enrichment methods remains rudimentary and ad
              hoc. In the absence of suitable gold standards, evaluations are
              commonly restricted to selected datasets and biological reasoning
              on the relevance of resulting enriched gene sets. RESULTS: We
              develop an extensible framework for reproducible benchmarking of
              enrichment methods based on defined criteria for applicability,
              gene set prioritization and detection of relevant processes. This
              framework incorporates a curated compendium of 75 expression
              datasets investigating 42 human diseases. The compendium features
              microarray and RNA-seq measurements, and each dataset is
              associated with a precompiled GO/KEGG relevance ranking for the
              corresponding disease under investigation. We perform a
              comprehensive assessment of 10 major enrichment methods,
              identifying significant differences in runtime and applicability
              to RNA-seq data, fraction of enriched gene sets depending on the
              null hypothesis tested and recovery of the predefined relevance
              rankings. We make practical recommendations on how methods
              originally developed for microarray data can efficiently be
              applied to RNA-seq data, how to interpret results depending on
              the type of gene set test conducted and which methods are best
              suited to effectively prioritize gene sets with high phenotype
              relevance. AVAILABILITY:
